### Creating a Toast Notification or Snack Bar for a Website Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

In this implementation, we will design a toast notification (or snack bar) with the following features:

A progress bar will be incorporated to indicate the duration before the notification disappears.
CSS animations will be used to animate the snack bar, ensuring smooth visual transitions.
The toast notification will automatically disappear after a set amount of time without requiring user interaction.
